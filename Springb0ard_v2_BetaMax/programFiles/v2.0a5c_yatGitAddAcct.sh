Purpose
Add the git global variables by setting up a home git directory
later this can be used to monitor server processes and crontab 
also this needs to use a script to initialize a new directory with dudes tools
add to the dude command that way we dont actually have to add that script to these directories before running the dude 
command. it will just run from /etc/springb0ard...
Make a modified script from the example dir in springb0ard.
